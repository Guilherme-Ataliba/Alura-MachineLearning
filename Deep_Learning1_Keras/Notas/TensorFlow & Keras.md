Tensor Flow is a python API developed by google with the purpose of using deep learning and other types of neural networks. However, the library showed itself difficult to use in its original form. To solve this problem a high-level interface named **keras** was developed. 
- Thus, keras is a package inside tensor flow with the intent of making it easier to use the original library.
