This chapter is dedicated to techniques of preprocessing the data, like removing "useless" words, making important words more frequent, etc.


# ðŸ”µ Stop Words
In the context of Natural Language Models, words that have no meaning to a machine learning model and are basically useless in that sense, are called stop words. 
- These are the words that usually show up more in a text, since they are articles, conjunctions, etc.

Since this is a deeply studied topic, there is a list of stop words publicly available that can be used to remove them from the input beforehand. 

### ðŸŸ¢ In Python
Following there's an example of a script that remove stop words from the data and creates a new pandas column with it:

```python
stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words("portuguese")

for item in resenha.text_pt:
Â  Â  nova_frase, frase_processada = list(), list()
Â  Â  token_espaco = nltk.tokenize.WhitespaceTokenizer()
Â  Â  palavras_texto = token_espaco.tokenize(item)

Â  Â  for palavra in palavras_texto:
Â  Â  Â  Â  if palavra not in stop_words:
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  nova_frase.append(palavra)

Â  Â  frase_processada.append(" ".join(nova_frase))

resenha["tratamento_1"] = frase_processada
```
- Notice that to access the stop words from `nltk` you have to download it using a method from the package.
