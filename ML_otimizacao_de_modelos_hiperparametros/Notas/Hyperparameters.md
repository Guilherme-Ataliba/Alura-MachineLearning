# Motivation
This course is about how to find the best hyperparameters for the model you studying.


# Overfitting
Something important to remember about overfitting is that the performance decreases for the test data. But this only happens because it has learning "too well" the training data. Thus, as the model gets more and more overfitted we expect the metrics on the test data to be come worse while the metrics on the trainig data to become better and better (with overfit).
